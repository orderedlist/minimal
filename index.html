        <h1>NIH Cancer Imaging Data Repositories for Biomedical Data Science Research</h1>
        
        <h2>Date: TBD</h2>
        <h2>Time: TBD</h2>
<br><br>
        The National Cancer Institute (NCI), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has made significant investments in the
creation and development of public data repositories to enable and promote sharing and secondary analysis of cancer
imaging data through an open science approach. Since its inception in 2011, The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) has
provided the imaging research community with a stable and reliable resource for sharing de-identified clinical
radiology (DICOM), and more recently digital pathology images of a variety of cancers. A growing number of
collections in TCIA contain clinical metadata, annotations, and third-party analysis results.
<br><br>
Recently NCI has launched the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an enterprise of cloud-based data
repositories and resources dedicated to key information modalities in cancer research (including genomics,
proteomics, and imaging) to provide the research community with a virtual and expandable infrastructure to enable
cross-domain data analysis and archival. Adhering to FAIR principles in cancer informatics, CRDC aims to further
enable innovations in data science in oncology. Imaging Data Commons (IDC), the imaging node in CRDC, publicly
released in October 2020, connects researchers with image collections from TCIA and beyond, through a robust
infrastructure containing metadata, image-derived data (segmentations, annotations, and image-based analysis
results), allowing image browsing and connectivity to Cloud Resources for image computation, data analysis, and
archival of the results. Direct connectivity of IDC data to robust Google analytics and ML tools is an important feature
of this platform.
<br><br>
This tutorial aims to familiarize attendees with TCIA, IDC, their similarities and differences in features and capabilities,
including search, browsing, downloading (through TCIA), viewing and cohort collection (through IDC), and cloud
computation through the NCI Cloud Resources. All levels are welcome.
